# Molecuscript
(not done!) python interpreter for a language based on the structure of organic compounds.

here is the input for the "Hello ,World!" program:
`1-(1-oxy-1-sulfyl-1-(2-(2,3,4-tris(methyl)cyclobutyl)-3-(2-ethylcyclopropyl)cyclopropyl)methyl)-1-(1-oxy-1-sulfyl-1-(2-(2-methyl-4-octylcyclobutyl)-3-(2-methylcyclopropyl)cyclopropyl)methyl)-4-(1-phospho-1-(2-heptyl-3-ethylcyclopropyl)methyl)-5-(1-phospho-1-(2,4-bis(methyl)cyclobutyl)methyl)-7,7,18-tris(1-phospho-2-oxy-2-(2-methylcyclopropyl)ethyl)-10,15-bis(1-phospho-2-oxy-2-(2-ethylcyclopropyl)ethyl)-11-(1-phospho-1-(2-propyl-3-ethylcyclopropyl)methyl)-12-(1-phospho-1-(2,3-bis(butyl)cyclopropyl)methyl)-13-(1-phospho-1-(2-octyl-3-heptylcyclopropyl)methyl)-16-(1-phospho-1-(2,3-bis(methyl)-4-butylcyclobutyl)methyl)-19-(1-phospho-1-(2-methylcyclobutyl)methyl)-20-(1-phospho-1-(2,3-bis(propyl)cyclopropyl)methyl)-21-(1-sulfyl-1-phosphomethyl)henicosane`

Currently there is only data saving and loading, but i do kinda know how im gonna do flow control, arithmetic etc.

there are other files with my ideas and concepts for it, but they arent polished and might have conflicting info.

take what you will from it; it was only created for a coding jam.
