when making an alkane occur multiple times on another alkane, do not make it like:
1,2-dimethyl

make it:
1,2-bis(methyl)

use the brackets when defining nested alkanes with multiple indexes, and di-tri for adding other elements.

more examples:

1,2-diethylpentane   x
1,2-bis(ethyl)pentane   √

1,3,4-tribromobutane √
1,3,4-tris(bromo)butane x

2-methylpentane √ (brackets are optional because only one index was specified)

    This is a "feature" resulting from a bug, and will likely be removed, eg brackets will always be optional for those alkanes

to specify integers, use cycloalkanes:

The following n-(2-methyl-3-propyl-4-ethylcyclobutane):
      ... - C - ...
            |
            C
          /   \
 C - C - C     C - C
          \   /
            C
            |
            C
            |
            C
represents "132".
do not place groups on the first index of the group, as that is already connected to a branch leading to the main branch. this is pretty much just to make 3d visualisation easier in the future.

if you want to specify a point in memory:
    place an oxyl group on the same point as the cycloalkane, and that will make the number it represents the pointer value.


if you want to create the integer in-line:
    just dont use the oxyl group
